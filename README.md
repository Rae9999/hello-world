First time

Learning computer science is confusing, and weird. There's just so much that I don't understand about it! I'm really excited to be learning all things involved with STEM. But I have a long way to go before I'm ready to start teaching anything. 
That's what i really want to do! Teach, I want to teach girls and boys alike that they can do anything!
